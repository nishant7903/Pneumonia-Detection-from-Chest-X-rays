# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-rays
It focuses on detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images using Deep Learning (CNN) and providing explainability through Grad-CAM visualizations. The solution is deployed as a Flask-based web application with a medical-themed UI.
# Final Project Goal
Build a robust CNN classifier for pneumonia detection.
Integrate Grad-CAM to highlight infected regions for transparency.
Deploy as a user-friendly web app for healthcare use cases.
